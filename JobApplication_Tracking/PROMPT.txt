Hi Pitamber

I am currently working as a Software QA Engineer at Siemens EDA in Wilsonville, Oregon. Recently, my position was impacted as part of a company-wide workforce rebalancing initiative.

I bring extensive experience in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), particularly in PERC, DRC, and LVS for physical verification. In addition, I have prior experience in Post-Silicon Validation at AMD, where I worked as a System-Level Test Engineer.

I am actively seeking immediate opportunities and am open to relocation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Chinmay Rozekar
